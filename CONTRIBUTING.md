# How to contribute

## Drawings
The SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics) files are created with Inkscape (https://inkscape.org/).
This application has this file format as it's default storage format.
If you want to preserve the layers in the drawing, you must save it as; Inkscape SVG (*.svg).
You can find the metadata of every drawing in; File --> Document Properties --> Metadata. Change the Date if you edit the drawing.


## Open Questions
* Is there a detailed drawing or document, about the cable harness of the buggy wiring or the Chery 1100cc motor?
* Datasheets of the electronic parts are always welcome.
